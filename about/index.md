I am a software developer and consultant and am always dabbling in various technologies, generally with a web 2.0, mobile, or slightly hardware related slant. I would like to document these projects online so others can benefit from the knowledge as I have from other blogs.

I hope you find these posts to be useful, whether you too are a tech enthusiast, a food lover, or a regular user looking for some technology guidance.
