While moving to a new provider (Slicehost), I successfully backed up all my post and blog content, but I didn't backup my theme. So now I forgot what theme it was AND lost the tweaks I made to it :(

How unfortunate! I'll spend the next few weeks fixing this, but I can't right now because I'm swamped with consulting work, and setting up [the business](http://www.kznconsulting.com).

Update: Found Hemingway for Wordpress. This was my post. Now I have to retrieve the really nice floating top navigation I had. That one I found on someone's blog so there's no way I'm going to find that again. DAMN.
