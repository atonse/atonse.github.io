This weekend, I accomplished 3 DC firsts. These were 3 quintessentially "DC" things to do, that I hadn't done in my 16 years in the place I call home:



	
  * Visited the farmers' markets in the Eastern Market/Capitol Hill area

	
  * Cherry Blossom Festival at the Tidal Basin

	
  * Jazz on U Street (Bohemian Caverns, unique atmosphere, good food, great music)


It made me think about all the other things I haven't discovered in this amazing city and the surrounding area, which inspired me to compile a sort of "bucket list" but for the summer. This is going to be a live list that I'd like to tick off and blog about as I accomplish these things.

<!-- more -->

The criteria for the list are as follows:

	
  * Must happen in the DC Metro Area (or within a 2 hour drive)

	
  * Must not take more than a day to complete (most activities will be a few hours at most)

	
  * Indoor or Outdoor, doesn't matter

	
  * Preferably something more unique to DC (watching movies doesn't count)

	
  * If I haven't done it in 2-3 years, it counts.


Without further ado, the list (in no particular order):

	
  * Ride the Capital Crescent Bike Trail

	
  * Ride the Beach Drive Bike Trail

	
  * Ride the Mount Vernon Bike Trail

	
  * At least 1 restaurant on DCFoodies' list of favorites

	
  * Go to the top of the Washington Monument

	
  * White House (sober, during the day, and not when on one of my introspective drives at 2am)

	
  * National Air and Space Museum's Udvar-Hazy Center (near Dulles Airport)

	
  * Dupont Circle Farmers Market

	
  * Outdoor concerts by the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps Bands at the Capitol grounds

	
  * (From Limbo in comments) USMC Band at the Barracks on I St, and at the Iwo Jima Memorial (Tuesdays)

	
  * Performance at the Carter-Barron Amphitheater on 16th St

	
  * Performance at the Kennedy Center (I used to go 4-5 times a year, haven't gone in ages)

	
  * Performance at the 9:30 club (seeing Prodigy there on May 18)

	
  * Performance at Wolftrap

	
  * Grab a Telescope and go see the stars at night in Shenandoah Valley

	
  * Ethiopian Food on U St

	
  * At least one more Jazz club on U St (apart from my regular Utopia and now, Bohemian Caverns)


Suggestions on things to add?
