Has anyone encountered this dialog when dealing with Excel and comma-separated values (CSV) files?

Every single time I see it, I have to re-read all the text and analyze exactly what my options are.

They have not changed this dialog even in 2007 with new UI improvements. Is this dialog clear to everyone else? I doubt it.
