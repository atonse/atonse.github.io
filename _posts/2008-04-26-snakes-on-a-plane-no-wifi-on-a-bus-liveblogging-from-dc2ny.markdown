title: Snakes on a Plane? No, Wifi on a Bus! Liveblogging from DC2NY

So I'm headed to NY today to show the cousin around (I wasn't expected to go but it ended up being a last minute thing). So I have my laptop with me because the bus to NY has free Wifi on board. Cool!!

So I'm eager to test it out and see how well it works. My guess is that they are using a Verizon EV-DO wireless card hooked up to a router (something like a femto-cell). I might do some tests, but I don't expect to do much more than just IM and browse the web. Don't want to abuse the connection

9:17 - And we're off. It's interesting to see downtown DC on a weekend morning. I barely ever get this view because I have never lived downtown, nor do I usually wake up early enough to go downtown. My brother's talking to his Danish friend (see Chris I mentioned you!) and hopefully we got some good tips out of it.

9:22 - The internet is not up yet. I am writing this blog post in textmate so it's not too much of a big deal. But I'm going to wait for a good 30-45 minutes before I cry foul. It could just be one of those things where it takes 45 minutes to boot up the equipment. ;-)

9:27 - Another dude opened up his laptop - he's got a macbook pro. It's awesome to see more people using macs.

9:36 - We just got the Wifi password. I'm glad it's password protected (although it's WEP but who's going to be anal about wifi security on a bus?)  We also just took a vote on what movie to watch, I voted for Top Gun :-) Needless to say, a lot of people are not happy that they were overruled on the Top Gun vote. I just have to say... I don't like you, Maverick. I don't like you because you're dangerous.
, and all
9:40 - We're on New York Ave. Hee Hee!

9:43 - Just realized that I didn't charge the macbook last night. I've got an hour. Damn!!!

9:53 - There are 3 of us on the bus using the internet (that I can see), and all 3 are on macbooks! We are slowly becoming the majority in these kinds of settings. I'm sure PC notebooks are still overwhelmingly popular in the enterprise, but they have to be feeling the pain when it comes to home users.
