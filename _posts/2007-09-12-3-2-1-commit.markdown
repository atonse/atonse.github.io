This past weekend, I participated with the [Open Source Connections](http://www.opensourceconnections.com) (O19s) team of Eric Pugh, Jim Nist, and Michael Herndon, in [RailsRumble](http://www.railsrumble.com)!

Check out our entry, Fish4Brains: [http://takemeaway.railsrumble.com](http://takemeaway.railsrumble.com) and [vote](http://vote.railsrumble.com/teams/takemeaway) for us!

I'll have more details about this project, the underlying technologies, and stories from working on a 2-day project.
